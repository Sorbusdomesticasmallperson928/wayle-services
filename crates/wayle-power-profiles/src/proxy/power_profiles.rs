/// environment to switch system power profiles based on user choice, or user intent.

/// OS components would typically use the "Profiles" property to construct their UI
/// (2 or 3 profiles available), and monitor the "ActiveProfile" and the
/// "PerformanceDegraded" properties to update that UI. The UI would try to set the
/// "ActiveProfile" property if the user selected a different one.
